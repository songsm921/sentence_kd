       " Q: Let $O(0,0), A(\\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\\mathcal{F}$ other than $\\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \\tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.\n",
       "\n",
       "<think>\n",
       "Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B given in the coordinate plane. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family of segments F, which are all unit length and lie in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The problem mentions a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I need to visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me calculate the coordinates of A and B:\n",
       "\n",
       "A is (1/2, 0), which is halfway between O(0,0) and (1,0). B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is halfway between O(0,0) and (0, sqrt(3)). So, triangle OAB is a right triangle with legs of length 1/2 and sqrt(3)/2. The hypotenuse AB can be found using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is a unit length segment, which makes sense because the family F consists of unit length segments.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, the family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, for each P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis such that the distance between P and Q is 1, we have a segment PQ in F.\n",
       "\n",
       "The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, not equal to A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is a point on AB that is only intersected by AB from the family F, and no other segment from F passes through C.\n",
       "\n",
       "I need to find OC squared. So, OC is the distance from the origin to point C, and I need to square it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me think about how to approach this. Since C is on AB, I can parametrize AB. Let me find the equation of line AB first.\n",
       "\n",
       "Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, I can parametrize AB using a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we are at A(1/2, 0), and when t=1, we are at B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations are:\n",
       "\n",
       "x = 1/2 - (1/2)t\n",
       "\n",
       "y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t\n",
       "\n",
       "So, x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (sqrt(3)/2)t.\n",
       "\n",
       "Therefore, any point C on AB can be written as ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, I need to find the point C on AB such that it is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, C should not lie on any other PQ segment where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, to find such a point C, I need to ensure that for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, for all other PQ segments, C should not lie on them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, since C is on AB, and AB is one of the segments in F, we need to find a point on AB that is not on any other segment from F.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, perhaps the point C is the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ in F. So, to find such a point, I need to find a point on AB that is not on any other PQ.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, maybe the point C is the point where AB is tangent to some other PQ segments? Hmm, not sure.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, perhaps another approach: For each point C on AB, check if there exists another PQ in F such that C lies on PQ. If such a point exists, then C is not our desired point. So, we need to find a point C on AB such that there does not exist another PQ in F passing through C.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me consider a general point C on AB: ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t). Now, suppose there exists another segment PQ in F such that C lies on PQ. Then, PQ is a segment from P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), with sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, since PQ has length 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since C lies on PQ, it must satisfy the equation of the line PQ. The equation of PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1, because it's a line intercepting the x-axis at p and y-axis at q.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, plugging in the coordinates of C into this equation:\n",
       "\n",
       "[(1 - t)/2]/p + [(sqrt(3)/2)t]/q = 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "But since PQ is a segment of length 1, we have sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, we have two equations:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. [(1 - t)/2]/p + [(sqrt(3)/2)t]/q = 1\n",
       "\n",
       "2. p^2 + q^2 = 1\n",
       "\n",
       "We need to find t such that there are no solutions (p, q) to these equations, except when PQ is AB itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but AB is a specific PQ segment where P is A(1/2, 0) and Q is B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, in that case, p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, which satisfies p^2 + q^2 = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, for AB, the equation of PQ is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1, which simplifies to 2x + (2/sqrt(3))y = 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, for the point C on AB, we can write:\n",
       "\n",
       "2x + (2/sqrt(3))y = 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "But since C is on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, we can substitute y into the equation:\n",
